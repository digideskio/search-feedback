**Search Quality Feedback Toolkit**

One of the best ways to improve search quality and user satisfaction is to provide your users with an easy way to give feedback.  These automated tools make it easy for your users to provide feedback such as:
  * "I really like this new search results user interface!"
  * "How can I promote my engineering design doc to the top of the search results?"
  * "I like the new glossary Onebox, but how can I contribute another Onebox idea?"

The example below shows a Quick Feedback box that automatically sends the user's query with their feedback to a designated mailing list or administrator and then automatically disappears:

The example below can be added to the bottom of your search results page to allow users to tell you if they found everything easily:

And, it will automatically ask them if they want to elaborate if they choose _No_:
